This was my final project for AP Calculus AB in which I had to create a presentation on a mathematician and also do a demonstration of a math formula/concept they were responsible for. I choose to do Martin Hellman and to demonstrate the diffie-hellmam-key-exchange. This was a fun project and even though it was challenging at first, I got to explain an integral part of internet security. The project is the programmatic representation of this concept that I showed on the classroom whiteboard.
