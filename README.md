# diffie-hellman-key-exchange

This was a my final project for AP Calculus AB in which I had to create a presentation and also do a demonstration of a math formula/concept they were responsible for. I chose to do Martin Hellman and I chose to demonstrate the diffie-hellmam-key-exchange. This was a fun project and even though it was challenging at first, I got to explain an integral part of internet security. The project is a programmatic representation of this concept that I represented on the classroom whiteboard.
